```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code snippet was incomplete. To make it a proper JavaScript function that calculates the sum of two
numbers, you need to:

1. **Define parameters:** The function needs to accept two input values (arguments) that you want to add together. I've
added `a` and `b` as parameters within the parentheses `(a, b)`.
2. **Return the result:** The `return` statement is crucial. It specifies the value that the function will output after
performing the addition.

**How to use the function:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // Call the function with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result); // Output: 8

let anotherResult = sum(10, -2); // Call with 10 and -2
console.log(anotherResult); // Output: 8
```
